# lets_go_soundboard

A soundboard app made in Flutter featuring some of my favorite sound effects
including those personal to me. This is also a cute little first Flutter app project.
Super simple!

## Getting Started

* Simply add your soundfile to the soundboard folder, add an entry in the soundlist.json, and optionally an icon!
* You can also improve the look of the app or extend it's functionality.
